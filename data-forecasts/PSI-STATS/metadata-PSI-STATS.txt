methods: 'Forecasts are produced using a suite of statistical models and data pre-conditioning 
  routines.  Retrospective analysis of backfill is used to nowcast the current state of the data.'
team_funding: CDC/CSTE Cooperative Agreement number NU38OT00029
data_inputs: Initially, we use only the supplied market-level CLI data.
methods_long: "For each market we first estimate the correction to the time-series due to\
  \ under-reporting. Once we have a nowcast time-series it is smoothed using three methods: moving\
  \ average, double moving average and a spline. We then perform a retrospective fit/forecast on\
  \ each of the three time-series and the nowcast data and calculate the error of the forecasts for\
  \ each one.  We select the time-series with the lowest error and use that one for the fit/forecast.\
  \ An auto-ARIMA is used for the fit/forecast and the quantiles are generated assuming a normal\
  \ distribution of the forecast."
